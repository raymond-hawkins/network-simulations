# Simulated EI-networks
The purpose of this minimal working example of an EI-network is to formulate hypothesis for in-vitro experiments of 3D neural cell cultures.


## Pre-requisits
In order to run the ipython notebook, simply install all needed dependencies via pip:

```bash
pip install teili
```

**NOTE**

We highly recommend using a virtual environment such as miniconda3.

## Hypothesis
*  **Balance vs. Oscilliations**
*  **Homeostatic Activity Driven Plasticity**
*  **Expression of predicition-errors**
